# CS335-Project

- Primitive data types (e.g., int, long, float, double, and boolean)
- Multidimensional (max 3D) arrays. You can ignore Java-style declarations (e.g., int[][] a
= ...) and only support C-style declarations (e.g., int a[][] = ...).

### Basic operators:

- Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, %, ++, –
- Preincrement, predecrement, postincrement, and postdecrement
- Relational operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
- Bitwise operators: &, |, ˆ, ˜, ≪, ≫, ≫
- Logical operators: &&, ||, !
- Assignment operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, &=
- Ternary operator
- Ignore the <> operator<br><br>

- Control flow vila if-else, for, and while, ignore constructs like do-while and switch
- Methods and method calls, including both static and non-static methods
- Support for recursion
- Support the library function println() for only printing the primitive types listed earlier
- Support for classes and objects. For class definitions, support public and private access
modifiers, ignore default and protected. Support for nested/inner classes is not required.
- Ignore support for import ... statements as a basic feature.
